# OneStock

**Summary**

Current stock brokerages do not track how much money a single investor makes or loses on individual stocks over their investing career. OneStock solves this problem by allowing investors to track their individual stock performance over their investing career and persisting that information in a DBMS. The system developed to resolve and simplify this issue involves an easy-to-use web-based application which allows investors to log into the application (via JWT) and simply add their order information without having to enter any formulas or create any tables. The system also allows investors to keep track of their other assets such as any real estate, crypto currencies, bonds, cash, and commodities assets they may own as an added bonus. The user is able to modify or delete any of these assets later in the future. The project utilizes React for its front-end framework, and Django for developing its RESTful API The project also utilized mySQL for the database.
